# Image-Preprocessing
Preprocessing an image to get the best result for detecting objects.
One of the important parts af the every project in machine learning is preprocessing which can be confusing.
Mostly the models need help for learning and we provide them some extra hand-made datas in order to recieve better result.
In this repository we tried to make new images with implementing edge detections on images.
The main puprpos of this project was finding the most clear image of the edges of our images.
